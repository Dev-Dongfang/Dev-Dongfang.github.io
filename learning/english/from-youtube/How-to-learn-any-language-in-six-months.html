<p>The people in the back, can you hear me clearly? Ok, good. </p>
<p>Have you ever held a question in mind for so long that it becomes part of how you think? Maybe even who you are as a person? Well I’ve had a question in my mind for many many years and that is: How can you speed up learning? Now, this is a interesting question because if you speed up learning, you can spend less time at school. And if you learn really fast, you probably wouldn’t have to go to school at all. Now, when I was young, school was sort of OK but I found quite often that school got in the way of learning, so I had this question in mind: How do you learn faster? And this begin when I was very very young, when I was 11years old, I wrote a letter to researchers in the Soviet Union, asking about hypnopaedia, this is sleep-learning, where you get a tape recorder, you put it beside your bed and it turns on in the middle of the night when you sleeping and you’re supposed to be learning from this. A good idea, unfortunately it doesn’t work. But, hypnopaedia did open the doors to research in other areas and we’ve had incredible discoveries about learing that begin with that firsh question. (1:34) </p>
<p>I went on from there to become passionate about psychology and I have been involved in psychology in many different ways for the rest of my life up until this point. In 1981, I took myself in China and I decidedthat I was going to be native level Chinese inside two years. Now you need understand that in 1981, everybody thought Chinese is really really difficult and a Westerner could study for 10 years of more and never get really good at it. And I also went in with a different idea whitch was: taking all of the collusions from psychology research up to that point and applying them to the learning process. What was really cool was that in six months I was fluent in Mandarin Chinese and it took a little bit long to get up to native. But I looked around and I saw all of these people from different countries struggling terribly with Chinese, I saw Chinese people struggle terribly to learn English of other languages, and so my question got refined down to: How can you help a nomal adults learn a new language quickly, easily, effectively? Now this is a really really important question in today’s world. We have massive challenges with environment, we have massive challenges with social dislocation, with wars, all sorts of things going on and if we can’t communicate, we’re really going to have difficulty solving these problems. So we need to speak each other’s languages, this is really really important. The question is: How do you do that? Well, it’s actually really easy. You look around for people who can already do it, you look for situations where it’s already working and you identify the principles and apply them. It’s called modelling and I’ve been looking at language learning and modelling language learning for about 15 to 20years now. And my conculsion, my observation from this is that any aldult can learn a second language to fluency inside six months.(3:42)</p>
<p>Now when I say this, most people think I’m crazy, this is impossible. So let me remind everybody of the history of human progress, it’s all about spanding our limits. In 1950, everybody believed running one mile in four minites is impossible, and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956 and from there it’s got shorter and shorter. 100 years ago, everybody believed that heavy stuff does’t fly. Expect it does and we all know this. How does heavy stuff fly? We reorganise the material using principles that we have learned from observing nature, birds in this case. And today we’ve got even further, so we can fly a car. You can buy one of these for a couple 100US dollars. We now have cars  in the world that fly. And this is different way to fly like whitch we’ve learned from squirrels. So all you need to do is  copy what a flying squirrel does, build a suit called a wing  suit and off you do, you can fly like a squirrel. Now most people, a lot of people, I won’t say everybody but alot of people think they can’t draw. However there are some key principles, five principles, that you can apply to learning to dray and you can actually learn to draw in  five days. So if you draw like  this,you learn these principles for five days and apply them and after five daysyou can draw something like this. Now I know this is true because that was my first frawing and after  five daysof applying these principles that was what I was able to do.And I looked at this and I  went: “Wow, so that’s how I look like  when I’m concentrating so intensely that my brain is exploding.” So anybody can learn to drawing in five days. And in the save way, with the same logic, anybody can learn a second language in six months. How? there are five principles and seven actions. There may be a few more but  there  are absolutely core. And before I got into those I just want to talk abouut two myths, I want to dispel two myths. The first is that you need talent. Let me tell you about Zoe. Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, was trying to learn Dutch, struggling extremely extremely a great deal and finally people were saying: “You’re completely useless,” “you’re not talent” “give up” “you’re a waste of time”, and she was very very depress. And then she came across there five principles, she moved to Brazil and she applied them and in six months she was fluent in Portuguese, so talent does’t matter. People also think that immersion in a new country is the way to learn a language. But look around Hong Kong loo at all the westerners who’ve been here for 10 years, who don’t speak  a word of Chinese. Look at all the Chinese living in America, Britain, Auustralia, Canada have been there 10 years and they don’t speak any English. Inmersion per se  does not work. Why? because a drowning man can’t learn to swim. (6:52)</p>
<p>When you don’t speak a language, you’re like a baby. And if you drop yourself into a context whitch is all adults talking about stuff over your head, you won’t learn. So what are the five principles that you need to pay attention to? First, four words, attention, meaning, relevance and memory, and these interconnect in very very important ways. Especially when you’re talking about learning. Come with me  on a journey though a forest. You go on a walk though a forest and you see something like this… Little marks on a tree, maybe you pay  attention maybe you don’t. You go another 50 meters and you see this… You should be paying attention. Another 50 meters, if you haven’t pay attention, you see this… And at this point, you’re paying attention. And you’ve just learned that this is import, it’s relevant because it means this, and anything that is related, any information related to your survival is stuff that you’re going pay attention to and therefore you’re going to remember if. If it’s related to your personal goals, then you’re going to pay attention to it. If it’s relevant, you’re going to remember it. So, the first rule, first principle for learning a language is focus on language content that is relevant to you.Which bring us tools.We master tools by use tools and we learn tools the fastest when they are relevant to us. So let me share a story. A keyboard is a tool. Typing Chinese a certain way, there are methods for this. That’s a tool. I had a colleague many years ago who went to night school, Tuesday night, Thursday night, two hours each time, practicing at home, she spent nine months, and she did not learn to type Chinese. And one night we had a crisis. We had 48 hours to deliver a training manual in Chinese. And she got the job, and I can guarantee you  in 48 hours, she learn a type of Chinese because it was relevant, it was mearningful, it’s important, she was using a tool to create value. So the second principle for learning a language is use your language as a tool to communicate right from day one. As a kid does. When I first arrived in China, I didn’t speak a word of Chinese, and on my second week, I got to take a train ride overnight. I spent 8 hours in the dinning car talking to one of the guards on the train, he took an interest in me for some reason, and we just chatted all night in Chinese and he was drawing pictures and making movements with his hands and facial epressions and piece by piece by piece I understood more and more. But what is really cool, was two weeks later, whe people talk Chinese around me, I was understandign some of this and I hadn’t even made any effort to learn that. What had happend, It’s absorbed it that night on the train, whitch brings us to the third principle. When you first understand the message, then you will acquire the language unconsciously. And this is really really well documented now, it’s somethign called comprehensible input. There’s 20 or 30 years of research on this, Stephen Krashen, a learder in the field, has published all sorts of these different studies and this is just from one of them. The purple bars show the scores on different tests for language. The purple people were people who had learned by grammar and formal study, the green ones are the ones who learned by coprehensible input. So, comprehension works. Comprehension is key and language learning is not about accumulating lots of knowledge. (10:30)</p>
<p>In many, many ways it’s about physiological training. A woman I know from Taiwan did great in English at school, she got A grades all the way through, wen through collage, A grades, went to the US and fond she couldn’t understand what people were saying. And people started asking her: “Are you deaf?” And she was. English deaf. Because we have filters in our brain that filter in the sounds that we are familiar with and they filter out the sounds of languages that we’re not. And if you can’t hear it, you won’t understand it, if you can’t understand it, you’re not going to learn it. So you actually have to be able to hear these sounds. And there are ways to do that but it’s physiological training. Speaking takes muscle. You’ve got 43 muscles in your face, you have to coordinate those in a way that you make sounds that other people would understand. If you’ve ever done a new sport for a couple of days, and you know how your body feels? Hurts? If your face hurting, you doing it right. And the final principle is state. Psycho-physiological state. If you’re sad, angry, worried, upset, you’re not going to learn. Period. If you’re happy, relaxed, in an Alpha brain state, curious, you’re going to learn really quickly, and very specifically you need to be tolerant of ambiguity. If you’re one of those people who needs to understand 100 percent every word you’re hearing, you will go nuts, because you’ll be incredibly upset all the time, because you are not perfect. If you’re comfortable with getting some, not getting some, just pay attension to what you do understand, you’re going to be fine, relaxed, and you’ll be learning quickly. So based on those five principles, what are the seven actions that youtake? Number one: Listen a lot. I call it brain soaking. You put yourself in a context where you’re hearing tons and tons and tons of a language and doesn’t matter if you’re understand or not. You’re listening to the rhythms, to pattens that repeat, you’re listening to things that stand out. So, just soak your brain in this. The senond action is that you get the mearning first, even before you get the words. You go: “Well how do I do that? I don’t know the words!” Well, you understand what these different postures mean. Human communication is body language in  many many ways, so much body language. From body language you can understand a lot of communication, therefore, you’re understanding, you’re acquiring through comprehensible input. And you can also use patterns that you already know. If you’re a Chinese specker of Mandarin and Cantonese and you go to Vietnam, you’ll understand 60 percent of what they say to you in daily conversation, because Vietnamese is baout 30 percent Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese. The third action: Start mixing. You probably have never thought of this but if you’ve got ten  erbs, ten nouns and 10 adjectives, you can say 1000 different of things. Language is creative process. What babies do? OK, “me”, “bath”, “now”. Ok, that’s how they communicate. So start mixing, get create, have fun with it, it doesn’t have to be prefect, just has to work. And when you doing this, you focus on the core. What does that mean? Well, any language is high frequency content. In english 1000 words covers 85 percent of anything you’re ever going to say in daily commucation. 3000 words gives you 98 percent anything you’re going to say in daily commucation. You got 3000 words, you’re specking the language. The rest is icing on the cake. And you’re just beginning with a new language, start with your tool box. Week number one, in your new language you say things like: “How do you say that?” “I don’t understand,” “repeat that please,” “what does that mean?” All in your target language. You’re using it as a tool, making it useful to you, it’s relevant to learn other things about the language. By week two, you should say things like: “me” “this” “you” “that” “give” “you know” “hot”, simple pronouns, simple nouns, simple verbs, simble adjective, communicating like a baby. And by the third or fourth week, you’re getting into “glue words”. “Although” “but” “therefore” these are logical transfermers that tie bits of a language together, allowing you to make more complex meaning. At that point you’re talking. (15:13)</p>
<p> And when you’re doing that, you should get yourself a language parent. If you look at how parents and children interact, you’ll understand what this means. When a children speaking, it’ll use simple words , simple combinations, sometime quite strange, somwtime very strange pronunciation, other family from outside the family don’t understand it. But the parents do. And so kids get a safe environment, gets confidence. The parents talk to the children with body language and the simple language they know the child will understands. So you have a comprehensible input environment that that’s safe, we know it works, otherwise none of you would speak your mother tongue. So you get yourself a language parent, who’s interested in you as a person, who will communicate with you essentially as an equel, but pay attention to help you understand the message. There are four rules of a language parent. Spouses are not very good at this, OK? But the four rules are, first of all, they will work hard to understand what you mean even you’re way off beat. Secondly, they will never corrent your mistakes. Thirdly, they  will feed back what their understanding of what you are saying so that you can respond appropriately and get that feedback and then they will use that words you know. The sixth thing you have to do, is copy the face. You got to get the muscles working right, so you can sound in a way that people will understand you. There’s a couple of things you do. One is that you hear how it feels, and feel how is sounds which means you have a feedback loop operating in your face, but idealy you can look at a native speaker and just observe how they use their face, let your unconscious mind absorb the rules, then you will going to be pick it up. And if you can’t get a native speaker to look at, you can use stuff like this… And the final idea here, the final action you need to take is that something I call “direct connect”. What does this mean? Well most of people learning a second language sort of take the tongue words and the target words and go over them  again and again in their mind to try to remember them. Really inefficient. What you need to do is realise that everything you know is an iamge inside your mind, it’s feelings, if you talk about fire, you can smell the smoke, you cna hear the cracking, you can see the flames, so what you do, is you go into that imagery and all of that memory and you come out with another pathway. So i call it “one box, different path”. You come out of the path way and you build it over time, you become more and more skilled at just connecting the new sounds to those images that you already have, into that internal representation. And over time you even become naturally good at that process, that becomes unconscious. So, there are five principles that you need to work with, seven actions, if you do any of them, you’re going to improve. And remember  these are things under your control as the learner. Do them all and you’re going to be fluent in a sencod language in six months. Thank you.</p>
