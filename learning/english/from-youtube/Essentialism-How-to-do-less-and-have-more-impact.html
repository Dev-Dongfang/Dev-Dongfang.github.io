<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong>：</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi loves! Welcome back to Lavendaire. I don’t know about you, but I offten feel this  pressure to do more. Like I’m not doing enough. And yet, everything I have to do is already too much for me to handle. We live in a  world that celebrates hustling and getting  more done. And because of that, so many of our stresses are  self-imposed. We set  high expectations for ourselves and aim to achieve more  than we ever have. And in oder to achieve that, we need push ourselves  further than we’ve pushed before. Don’t get me wrong, hard work is amazing and it’s what creates greatness. But true greatness is also recognizing  that you can’t do everying. And  it’s more worth your time to focus on doing one thing very well. And I continue to  design my  dream life, I  know that I want more space to breate and simply to be, to enjoy my life without  being  tied to a jam-packed schedule. </p>
<p>I want to do less, and focus only on the essential. To me,essentialism is about the  power of focus. Tony Robbins saids:”Where focus goes, energy flows”. If I try to do too many things at once, that energy is spread out in a very unimpactful way. But if you focus that energy on one valuable project or goal, that energy can make a huge impact. Remember, anyone can be busy, but busy is not always productive. It’s about what you work on rather than how much  you work. And can we really do less and be more productive? Yes, if we work on the right things. So it’s your ablity to choose the right things that will determine your success. Choose what important to you, what matters most, what will give you the highest return for your  time and efforts. To do that, you need to have laser sharp focus o your  vision, so you’re working on the most enssential thing rather than being distracted by  everying  else going  on.</p>
<p>The idea of enssentialism is:”Less, but better”. It means “living by design, not by default”, —whitch is what the artist of life journey is all about. So, here are the mistakes we often make(And comment below  if any of  these resonate with you): Spreading ourselves too thin. Saying yes to too many obligations. Trying to do so   much in so little time. My personal biggest mistake is always underrestimating how long it takes me  to do something. I expect to get a lot done in a day, but then at the  end of the day, I realize I did’t even get though most of things on my list, not even some important things on my list. And I feel defeated, disappointed and my confience suffers. And it just becomes this negative cycle that makes it harder to pick yourself up from. So instead of trying to  do too much, I learning to focus down and do  less. Only when you’ve yourself premission to stop trying to do it all, can you dedicate your time towards the things that really matter. So first, you gotta decide what’s valuable and what matters to you. If you don’t decide early on, other people and other factors are going to decide for you. So here are some questions to ask yourself(Fell free to pause and journal along): What do I want my life all to be about? What do I love? What do I Stand for? These are your values, your passions, your purpose. What is my definition of success? What does a happy, fillful life look like to me? In this ideal life, where does my energy and time go?</p>
<p>Next: Have you been doing anything for wrong reasons? You want to reflect and see if you’ve taken on too much because of the following reasons: Wanting to please others. Seeking approval for others. Trying to impress others. Trying to prove your worth to others. Comparing yourself to others. Being too afraid to say no. Fear of judgment, fear of rejection, fear of failure. All of these are the wrong reason to focus on when deciding what you should do with your life, with your time and efforts. Next question: How do I truly want to feel? If I don’t feel that way now, when will I? Aside from that material things, what we truely wish to attain in our dream life is a feeling, whether it’s a feeling of happiness, accomplishment, security, abundance, freedom, or something else. And we often dealy there feelings in our head for a future. We expect, once we achieve XYZ, then these felling will come. But the truth is: If all these are, are just feelings, you can choose to feel them now. Why wait for a future date to finally feel what you’ve always wanted to feel? So ask yourself: How can I cultivate these feelings now? Sure, some feelings need material achievement to be realized, like if you’re broke and hate not knowing how you’ll pay your next bill, having a stable career may make you feel finacially free and happier in that area of life. But also consider that same person, who now has a higher paying job, but is still stuck in that mindset of scarcity,  that the money they earn is never enough, and they feel like they have to keep working harder and harder and harder to earn even more and more and more. Even with more, they still don’t feel that finacial freedom and happiness they truly desire deep down. So, I’m just to say that, past a certain point of being able to have the basics to survive, it’s all about your mindset and perspective. You can choose how you want to feel right now, instead of chasing after it as if it only exists in the future. </p>
<p>What matters most to me know is: my health, wellbeing, and happiness of my loved ones and then comes the health of my business. This is a personal shift because I have speet years putting my career over my health: pulling too many all-nighters than I can count, stressing over things that, in hindsight, don’t really matter anymore. And also with the past few years dealing with Wilson’s health issues and now the pandemic, I’m just more grateful for the simplicity of good health as the most important thing in our lives. Material success and achievements come way after that. So even if I may not seem as “productive” on the outside, it’s because my priorities have shited, and what I deem valuable has changed. I can feel productive and proud of myself, doing things that quietly bring me joy and satisfaction, without having to prove it to the rest of the world on the social media. As someone who used to getting external validation and approval for my work, this is part of my journey learning to give my own approval. My growth does’t have to be visible to others and that’s okay. The bottom line is: You always have a choice in how you design your life. You choose how you spend your time and attention. You can choose to say no. Your might be judged by others for your choices, and that might be scary. But in the end, the most important opinoin that matters is your own. You don’t have to be all thing to all people. You don’t need to please everyone. You can’t make everyone happpy, but you can make you happy. The rule of thumb I like to use is: Say yes only if your body feels excited and attracted to this opportunity. If it’s maybe, hesitant feeling, then just say no. Saying no to something that does’t serve you means saying yes to yourself. You’ve leaving space for something that’s even better to enter your life. And trust me: I’ve said no to so many things—even thousands of dollars of opportunities—hust because it was a so—so feeling in my body, because I really trust my body and my intuition when to deciding what opportunities and projects to do. </p>
<p>Here’s an exercise you can do to start implementing essentialism into your life: Simplify and prioritize. First, make a list of your to-dos, goals, and responsibilities for the next three months. Go ahead, pause this vadio, and make a giant list, brainstorm, dump it all out on paper. Next ask youself, What is the item, out of all of these things, that has the greatest impact? When I say impact, I mean whatever matters most to you, whether it’s improving the quality of your life, or having a great financial impact, or anything else. So if you were to pick only one thing, what would it be? So now you know what’s important and essential. Next, go over your list and ask yourself: What items do I not have to do? What can I cut out? Always ask yourself: What can I eliminate or delegate? And take this time to pause and cross out all of the inessential. Whew! I hope that was very freeing, because I love taking things off my to-do list. So, next you want to get some momentum going. Start planning your next action steps for your one most essential goal or project.  </p>
<p>Now it’s time to pick the most important action steps to start with and put those in you to-do list and calendar. Finally, as you’re in motion working towards your important goal, set time aside to do a weekly clenup of your to do list. That’s time to declutter anything that is not essential. The key to making essentialism work is to let go of form. Accept that you are’t able to do it all and focusing on the essencial is a more effective usr of your time. Soon enough, you will understand how freeing it is to say no to things. You’ll feel more aligned to what’s valuable and what’s right for you. A big part of this is learning to let go of your distractions because distractions are not essencial. So spending too much time on social media, comparing yourself with others, and any unproductive habits that you would’t want to bring into your new life. Remember, if it doesn’t spark joy, leave it. When you’re finally focusing on the few essential things, the right things for you, you leave space for yourself. You get time to breathe, to sleep, to play, to reset and recharge, and to feel balanced. You also leave space for new opportunities to come into your life, opportunities that you wouldn’t have space for, if you were already so busy with so many other things. So the next time you come across a decision or challenge, ask “What is essential”, and eliminate everything else. Please share the video if it helped you.
